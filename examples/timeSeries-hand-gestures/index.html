      To add data, press the "Add Gesture #1 Data" button and then show your
      hand to the screen, put down your hand when you are done. You can record
      again once you show your hand back in the frame. Likewise for gesture #2.
      When you have a good amount of data for each gesture class, press the
      "Train and Save Model" button to train the model and save it for future
      use.

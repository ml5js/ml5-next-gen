## Code Formatting

To keep the coding style consistent, we will be using the Prettier formatter.

### Visual Studio Code

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can install the Prettier extension by going to the **Extensions** tab and search for "Prettier". Click on **Prettier - Code formatter** and click **Install**.

Go to **File > Preferences > Settings**, search for "default formatter" and make sure **Prettier - Code formatter** is selected for **Editor: Default Formatter**.

To automatically format a document when saving it, search for "format on save" in the settings and make sure **Editor: Format On Save** is checked. Otherwise, you can use the VS Code keyboard shortcut to format an opened document, which is <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> for Windows or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> for Mac by default.

### Command Line

You can also format a document via the command line. To format all JavaScript documents in the repo, use:

```
npm run format
```

To format a specific document, use

```
npx prettier --write path/to/file
```

For more options with the command line, refer to the [Prettier Documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html)
